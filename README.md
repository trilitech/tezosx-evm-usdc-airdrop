## TezosX EVM

Single-page Next.js app for sending a fixed USDC or XTZ airdrop to any valid EVM address entered in the UI.

The browser only submits the recipient address. The actual transaction is created and broadcast on the server using private keys stored in environment variables.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` or `.env`.
3. Fill in your funded private keys in `AIRDROP_PRIVATE_KEYS`.
4. Set `AIRDROP_TOKEN_ADDRESS` to your USDC token contract.
5. Adjust `AIRDROP_AMOUNT` and `NATIVE_AIRDROP_AMOUNT` if you want different fixed airdrop amounts.
6. Start the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Running The App

From the project directory:

```bash
cd evm-airdrop-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

For a production run:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

The app will serve the faucet UI on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Environment Variables

```bash
EVM_RPC=https://demo.txpark.nomadic-labs.com/rpc
AIRDROP_PRIVATE_KEYS=0xabc...,0xdef...
AIRDROP_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x...
AIRDROP_TOKEN_SYMBOL=USDC
AIRDROP_TOKEN_DECIMALS=6
AIRDROP_AMOUNT=10
NATIVE_AIRDROP_SYMBOL=XTZ
NATIVE_AIRDROP_AMOUNT=5
AIRDROP_GAS_RESERVE=0.001
EXPLORER_TX_URL_BASE=

NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_NAME=TezosX EVM
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_SUBTITLE=Tezos X Testnet Airdrop
NEXT_PUBLIC_EVM_RPC=https://demo.txpark.nomadic-labs.com/rpc
NEXT_PUBLIC_AIRDROP_AMOUNT=10
NEXT_PUBLIC_AIRDROP_TOKEN_SYMBOL=USDC
NEXT_PUBLIC_NATIVE_AIRDROP_AMOUNT=5
NEXT_PUBLIC_NATIVE_AIRDROP_SYMBOL=XTZ
```

## Notes

- `AIRDROP_PRIVATE_KEYS` can contain multiple comma-separated or newline-separated private keys.
- The UI exposes a clear asset selector so users can choose between `USDC` and `XTZ` while using one shared wallet input.
- The API route chooses the first configured wallet with enough balance to cover the selected airdrop and native gas.
- The default setup assumes USDC uses `6` decimals. Change `AIRDROP_TOKEN_DECIMALS` if your token differs.
- Add `EXPLORER_TX_URL_BASE` if you want the success state to include a transaction link.

## API

`POST /api/airdrop`

Request body:

```json
{
  "walletAddress": "0x...",
  "asset": "usdc"
}
```

Successful response includes the transaction hash and optional explorer link.

## Security

Do not expose your private keys through `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables. Only keep them in server-only env vars such as `AIRDROP_PRIVATE_KEYS`.
